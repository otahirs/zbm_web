Another edition of Sudety Cup is ahead of us and this time
we return to where it all began - Lasówka. It was in these
forests that the idea for the event was born, an event that
each year attracts more and more people seeking genu-
ine contact with nature and a peaceful, welcoming atmos-
phere. This year’s edition once again takes you deep into
the heart of Sudety wilderness - from the marshy, almost
flat plain around Siwa Skała, through the route-choice-
heavy slopes of Góra Kłobuk, to the mosaic landscape of
Mostowy Potok and the valley of Dzika Orlica where water,
undergrowth and terrain details will test your focus and
precision. Each stage has its own character, yet all share
the same goal: quality - carefully crafted maps, thought-
ful course setting and a unique atmosphere. We invite you
to take part and rediscover the Sudety step by step, con-
trol by control. See you in Lasówka

The deadline for all entries is 20.07.2026. Entries are to be
